# SwingSense 🏌️‍♂️🏌️‍♀️

## Inspiration
Golf has been a part of my life since I was five years old, and over the years, I’ve progressed from a beginner to holding an 8 handicap today. Along the way, I’ve faced challenges at every stage of the game, from struggling to hit consistent shots to refining advanced techniques. Even now, I’m constantly working to improve my game. Without professional lessons, self-learning can be frustrating—finding actionable feedback isn’t always easy. This inspired me to create SwingSense—a tool designed to provide golfers of all skill levels with personalized, AI-powered feedback to improve their swings, track progress, and make self-learning more effective and accessible.

## What It Does

Additionally, SwingSense allows users to log their feedback for future reference, helping them track their progress and identify trends in their performance.
